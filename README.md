# scrap-it

Introducing Scrap-It, a specialized web scraper designed to address the challenges of job searching. Many individuals encounter difficulties while looking for job opportunities in their respective fields across various platforms like naukri.com, indeed.com, and more. The abundance of websites makes it increasingly challenging to keep track of potential openings.

Our innovative web scraper efficiently gathers job details from these platforms and presents them to you in one centralized location. The information includes crucial factors such as Salary, Location, Job Type, and more.

We have relocated the scraper to the Saavrm26/scrap-it-scrapping repository to ensure a clear separation of concerns. This repository now contains both the frontend code and the routing code, enhancing organization and maintainability.
